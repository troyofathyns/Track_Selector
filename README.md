# Track_Selector
I'm not a coder but i do it as a hobby on ocassion so a lot of this is bare bones because of that.
Hopefully people will be able to use this for future Mario Kart 64 and other racing games that want to use this format.
If you want access please dm me on twitter(might take a bit because i'm still new to git).
